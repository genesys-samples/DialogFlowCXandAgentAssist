# The Genesys and Google Cloud Partnership

Here at Genesys, we have been growing our relationship with Google Cloud for some time. And the joint offerings that we bring together extend much further than the extent of this workshop that we will do today. As a matter of fact, Genesys and Google Cloud have a co-innovation agreement. What does that mean exactly? That means that our two companies will work together to create new products that will help businesses transform into people-centric experiences. Our efforts will evolve, but are starting out by looking at these key areas:

- Customer journey orchestration
- Automated customer care with integrated IoT and customer service
- Predictive customer satisfaction using Genesys with Google Cloud Cloud AI
- AI-driven multi-factor authentication with geolocation verification
- Unique conversational channels from Google Cloud Search, Google Cloud Maps and other Google Cloud services

So that's the future. If you're more concerned with what's happening today, we've got quite a list for you there as well: 

- Google Cloud TTS integrated into Genesys Architect
- Google Cloud Dialogflow ES (this is the older version of Dialogflow CX)

And of course, what we are covering today...
